# **Major Project Proposal**


## Project Description

For my major project, I would like to recreate the game "Plants vs Zombies" in Javascript using p5.js. Plants vs Zombies is a tower defense style game where you defend your lawn with plants, to stop the advancing hoard of Zombies. You must manage your sun and use stratgey to stop zombies from reaching your house, or they will eat your brain. 



## Needs To Have List

- Main adventure or level select mode with at least 1 level
    - similar to how the main game plays out, have a wave of zombies proceed through the screen and have a win objective (if you defend your lawn), and define loses (zombies reach end of the lawn)
- main menu
    - Have a main menu where you start the game with the press of a button
- unique plants and Zombies
    - have at least multiple unique plants to unlock during the adventure mode that behave in different ways. have different zombies of varying health for each level.
- background music and sound effects
    - incorporate background music for the main menu and levels, and proper sound effects for attacks and death sounds.
- give the zombies and plants mulitple sprits so you can alternate between to make it look like they are moving

## Nice to Have List

- have some way to store what level you have completed so you can continue from that point if you close the browser.
- along with the adventure mode, also create a endless mode, where instead of trying to beat a level, you are put in a level where zombies spawn endlessly and you try and last as long as possible.
- create a shovel so you can remove plants
- create some custom plants and zombies that are not in the orginal game
- add some kind of lawnmover system that will be a safe gaurd at the end of a lane
- add a way pause or continue a round by clicking a button. have the option to leave the level.
