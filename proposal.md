# **Major Project Proposal**


## Project Description

For my major project, I would like to recreate the game "Plants vs Zombies" in Javascript using p5.js. Plants vs Zombies is a tower defense style game where you defend your lawn with plants, to stop the advancing hoard of Zombies. You must manage your sun and use stratgey to stop zombies from reaching your house, or they will eat your brain. 



## Needs To Have List

- Main adventure mode with at least 5 levels
    similar to the main game, there will be an adventurmode with each following level having more difficulty, different zombies, and different plants. 
- main menu
    Have a main menu where you start the game with the press of a button
- unique plants and Zombies
    have at least 5 unique plants to unlock during the adventure mode that behave in different ways. have different zombies of varying health for each level.
- background music and sound effects
    incorporate background music for the main menu and levels, and proper sound effects for attacks and death sounds.
- pause menu
    make a way to pause or continue a round by clicking a button. have the option to leave the level.
- give the zombies and plants mulitple sprits so you can alternate between to make it look like they are moving

## Nice to Have List

- have some way to store what level you have completed so you can continue from that point if you close the browser.
- along with the adventure mode, also create a endless mode, where instead of trying to beat a level, you are put in a level where zombies spawn endlessly and you try and last as long as possible.
- create some custom plants and zombies that are not in the orginal game
- add some kind of lawnmover system that will be a safe gaurd at the end of a lane
