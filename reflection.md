# **Major Project reflection**


## what advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?

before writing any code, I should write down a progression sheet, so I know what to make in order. Making a progression sheet would help the project flow more smoothly, as you know you won't be implementing things you don't need early on. A progression sheet would also help with time management, as you would know what to do next.

## did you complete everything in your "needs to have" list?

yes. As for nice to have, I was able to add an endless mode, as well as a shovel feature.

## What was the hardest part of the project?

the hardest part for me was the transition between gamestates (mainmenu, winning cutscene, lossing cutscene, ect.). There was lots of bug fixing I had to do, and getting the music and background to match with the right gamestates took some time. 

## Were there any problems you could not solve?

There seems to be a small bug where the sound is sometimes distorted. My guess that the cause of this problem is overlapping sounds, but there is not really a good fix, and it doesn't affect gameplay.
